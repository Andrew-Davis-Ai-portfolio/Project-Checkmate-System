## 🧠 Overview  
**Project Checkmate System** is an **AI-driven business simulation game** where entrepreneurs play chess against the ultimate opponent — **Failure**.  
Each move represents a **strategic business decision**, and each defeat provides **data-driven feedback** to refine your model until it achieves real-world viability.  

**Goal:**  
Transform traditional business planning into an interactive feedback loop powered by artificial intelligence, strategy, and gamified learning.

## 🧩 Core Gameplay Loop  

1. **Idea Upload**  
   - The player enters a business idea in the input box.  
   - AI evaluates the idea, classifies it by market type, scalability, and automation potential.  

2. **AI Move — The Board Responds**  
   - The AI plays as the *advisor engine*, making a strategic move that reflects how your decision would play out in the market.  

3. **Opponent Move — Failure Counterattacks**  
   - “Failure,” the Final Boss AI, executes real-world risk simulations — financial breakdowns, market shifts, ethical conflicts, or mismanagement.  

4. **Player Adjusts Strategy**  
   - Review your AI-generated report, refine the concept, and re-enter the board.  
   - Every iteration strengthens your business intelligence and decision-making model.  

5. **Checkmate = Validation**  
   - Defeat “Failure,” and the system automatically generates a **Business Implementation Blueprint** with:  
     - Strength and weakness analysis  
     - Tool recommendations  
     - Optional affiliate automation integrations
